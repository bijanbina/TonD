\subsection{Bipolar Transistor Model}\vspace{0.5em}
Forward base transit time, $\tau_F$ is time need for electron go trough base to reach collector. In other word time needed for transistor become on or off. this effect is modeled by a capacitance called $C_b$ or $C_D$ (Diffusion capacitance) ~\\
\begin{equation}
C_b = \tau_F g_m ~~ , ~~\tau_F = \frac{W_B^2}{2D_n}
\end{equation}
~\\
$C_{\mu}$ or $C_j$ is junction reverse bias forward between base and collector which known as $C_{j0}$ is base-collector capacitance measured at zero bias. $V_j$ is junction reverse bias voltage that always assume positive and $V_b$ or $\phi_0$ is junction built-in voltage.~\\

\begin{equation}
C_j = \frac{C_{j0}}{\sqrt{1 + \frac{v_j}{v_b}}} ~~ , ~~ v_b = \frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2} 
\end{equation}

~\\which has maximum of $ 2 C_{j0} $. These capacitance affect intrinsic gain, $\beta$, which parametrized in two form, $f_T$ and $f_{\beta}$. $f_t$ is where $\beta=1$ and $f_{\beta}$ is the effective pole corner frequency~\\

\begin{equation}
f_{T,max} = \frac{1}{2\pi\tau_f} ~~ , ~~ f_{T} = \frac{g_m}{2\pi (C_{\mu} + C_\pi)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
f_{\beta} \cdot \beta = f_T \cdot 1
\end{equation}

~\\
\begin{equation}
C_{GS} = C_{GS,ov} + \frac{2}{3} C_{oxt} ~~ , ~~ C_{oxt} = C_{ox} W \cdot L_{eff}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
f_{T,max} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{v_{sat}}{\tau_f} ~~ , ~~ f_{T} = \frac{1}{2\pi (C_{GS} + C_{GD})}
\end{equation}~

where $v_{sat}$ is electron saturation velocity
