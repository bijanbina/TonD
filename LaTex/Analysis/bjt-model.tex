Forward base transit time, $\tau_F$ is time need for electron go trough base to reach collector. In other word time needed for transistor become on or off. ~\\
\begin{equation}
C_b = \tau_F g_m ~~ , ~~\tau_F = \frac{W_B^2}{2D_n}
\end{equation}
~\\
$C_{\mu}$ or $C_j$ is junction reverse bias forward between base and collector which known as $C_{j0}$ is base-collector capacitance measured at zero bias. $V_j$ is junction reverse bias voltage that always assume positive and $V_b$ or $\phi_0$ is junction built-in voltage.~\\
\begin{equation}
C_j = \frac{C_{j0}}{\sqrt{1 + \frac{v_j}{v_b}}} ~~ , ~~ v_b = \frac{N_A N_D}{n_i^2} 
\end{equation}
~\\which has maximum of $ 2 C_{j0} $

\begin{equation}
C_{GS} = C_{GS,ov} + \frac{2}{3} C_{oxt} ~~ , ~~ C_{oxt} = C_{ox} W \cdot L_{eff}
