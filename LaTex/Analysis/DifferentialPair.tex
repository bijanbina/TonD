\subsection{Differential Pair}
$$ \text{CMRR} = \frac{A_d}{A_c}$$
\subsubsection{Common Mode}
Input Case: To inject or draw currents into or from inputs the feedback network has to be shunt with amplifier.\\
Output Case: To sample currents from output we want to read current ( like amp meter ) so it has to be series with output.
\subsubsection{Differential Mode}
If we feed a single ended input that is not balanced ie $-\frac{vd}{2}$ and $+\frac{vd}{2}$ then we can consider that as a balanced signal whith a common noise of $\frac{v_d}{2}$ which is obviously affect output but not significantly.

In Common Drain, $R_D$ Is not used as it has very small impact on output gain, but it take down DC bias. so it not used practically

\subsubsection{OTA}\vspace{0.5em}

OTA is only a configuration to transform a differential pair to single ended output without halving output gain.
