To calculate multistage gain for a amplifier. first calculate gain from $V_{in}$ to $V_X$ considering next stage load. 
$$ A_1 = \frac{V_X}{V_{in}} = -g_{m1} R_D = -\frac{g_{m1}}{g_{m2}} $$
then the gain from $V_X$ to $V_{out}$ is
$$ A_2 = \frac{V_{out}}{V_{X}} = g_{m2} R_{O} = {g_{m2}}\,({g_{m2} r_{o1} r _{o2}}) $$
so the overall gain is
$$ A = A_1 \times A_2 = \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = {g_{m1}}\,({g_{m2} r_{o1} r _{o2}}) $$
note that for second stage there is no need to consider input resistance as it's already has been calculated as a load of first stage.

\subsection{Feedback}
\subsubsection{Current Feedback}
Input Case: To inject or draw currents into or from inputs the feedback network has to be shunt with amplifier.\\
Output Case: To sample currents from output we want to read current ( like amp meter ) so it has to be series with output.\\

\subsubsection{Voltage Feedback}
Input Case: To create voltage control amplifier the feedback network has to be series with signal to change input voltage.\\
Output Case: To sample voltage from output we want act like a voltage meter so it has to be shunt with output.

In Common Drain, $R_D$ Is not used as it has very small impact on output gain, but it take down DC bias. so it not used practically
