\subsection{FeedBack}
\subsubsection{Current Feedback}
Input Case: To inject or draw currents into or from inputs the feedback network has to be shunt with amplifier.\\
Output Case: To sample currents from output we want to read current ( like amp meter ) so it has to be series with output.
\subsubsection{Voltage Feedback}
Input Case: To create voltage controll amplifier the feedback network has to be series with signal to change input voltage.\\
Output Case: To sample voltage from output we want act like a voltage meter so it has to be shunt with output.

In Common Drain, $R_D$ Is not used as it has very small impact on output gain, but it take down DC bias. so it not used practically
